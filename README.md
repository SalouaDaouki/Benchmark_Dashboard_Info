# Here is how to use this Shiny app
**To analyze Last Year’s Data Only:**

If you want to explore last year’s benchmark results without comparing them to the current year:
	1.	Upload last year’s benchmark file under “Upload Current Year”.
	2.	Click Analyze Data.
	3.	Use all available tabs except Year-over-Year, which will remain empty because comparisons require two years of data.

This mode is useful when reviewing historical trends or preparing for curriculum mapping conversations.

**Using the Year-over-Year Comparison Feature**

To access predictions and identify concepts that may be at risk this year, you must upload both the current and previous year’s benchmark files:
	1.	Upload the current year file (e.g., 2025–2026) under “Upload Current Year”.
	2.	Upload the previous year file (e.g., 2024–2025) under “Upload Previous Year”.
	3.	Click Analyze Data.
	4.	Navigate to the Year-over-Year Comparison tab.
	5.	Select the grade you want to explore using the dropdown menu.

In this tab, you will see:
	•	A Predicted At-Risk Questions table, with color-coded risk levels (High, Medium, Low).
	•	A Benchmark 1 Comparison Graph, showing current-year and previous-year B1 averages for each question.

These outputs help teachers quickly identify which concepts are likely to require additional instruction this year and provide a clearer understanding of how student performance is trending over time.
