# Variable Dictionary
This document defines all variables used in the benchmark analysis tool, including variables found in the raw district-provided spreadsheets and variables generated by the Shiny application during processing, analysis, and visualization.

| Class_Mean               | Numeric                         | Mean score across all questions for a given class.                                               |
| Grade_Mean               | Numeric                         | Mean score across all classes within a grade level.                                              |
| Deviation_From_Grade     | Numeric                         | Difference between a class's question-level score and the grade-level mean.                      |
| Risk_Level               | Factor (Low/Medium/High)        | Assigned based on predicted B3 performance and prior-year patterns.                              |
| Status                   | Factor (Confirmed/Inconclusive) | Result of Welch’s t-test comparing current vs. previous year’s Benchmark 1.                      |
| Prev_B1, Prev_B2, Prev_B3 | Numeric                        | Previous year’s mean scores for each benchmark cycle.                                            |
| Current_B1               | Numeric                         | Current year’s Benchmark 1 score.                                                                |
| Predicted_B2             | Numeric                         | Estimated current-year Benchmark 2 score using last year’s B1→B2 growth.                         |
| Predicted_B3             | Numeric                         | Estimated current-year Benchmark 3 score using last year’s B2→B3 growth.                         |
| B1_Comparison            | Numeric                         | Difference between current-year and previous-year Benchmark 1 performance.                       |
